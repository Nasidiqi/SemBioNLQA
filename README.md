SemBioNLQA: A semantic biomedical question answering system for retrieving exact and ideal answers to natural language questions
===================

SemBioNLQA - Semantic Biomedical Natural Language Question Answering - has the ability to handle the kinds of yes/no questions, factoid questions, 
list questions and summary questions that are commonly asked in the biomedical domain. It is aimed to be able to accept a variety of natural language 
questions and to generate appropriate natural language answers by providing both exact and ideal answers (paragraph-sized summaries). It provides exact 
answers “yes” or “no” for yes/no questions, biomedical named entities for factoid questions, and a list of biomedical named entities for list questions. 
In addition to exact answers for yes/no, factoid and list questions, SemBioNLQA also returns ideal answers, while it retrieves only ideal answers for summary 
questions.
