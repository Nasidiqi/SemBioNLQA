SemBioNLQA - Semantic Biomedical Natural Language Question Answering - has the ability to handle the kinds of yes/no questions, factoid questions, 
list questions and summary questions that are commonly asked in the biomedical domain. It is aimed to be able to accept a variety of natural language 
questions and to generate appropriate natural language answers by providing both exact and ideal answers (paragraph-sized summaries). It provides exact 
answers “yes” or “no” for yes/no questions, biomedical named entities for factoid questions, and a list of biomedical named entities for list questions. 
In addition to exact answers for yes/no, factoid and list questions, SemBioNLQA also returns ideal answers, while it retrieves only ideal answers for summary 
questions.

SemBioNLQA is developed by  Dr. Mourad Sarrouti and Prof Said Ouatik El Alaoui at LIM laboratory, Faculty of Sciences Dhar El Mahraz, 
Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah University.
